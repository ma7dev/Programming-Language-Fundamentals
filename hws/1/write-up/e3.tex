\subsection{Define the function width that computes the width of a shape}

\input{code/3a.tex}

\subsection{Define the function bbox that computes the bounding box of a shape}

\input{code/3b.tex}

\subsection{Define the function minX that computes the minimum x coordinate of a shape}

\input{code/3c.tex}

\subsection{Define a function move that moves the position of a shape by a vector given by a point as its second argument}

\input{code/3d.tex}

\subsection{Define a function alignLeft that transforms one figure into another one in which all shapes have the same minX coordinate but are otherwise unchanged}

\input{code/3e.tex}

\subsection{Define a function inside that checks whether one shape is inside of another one, that is, whether the area covered by the first shape is also covered by the second shape}
